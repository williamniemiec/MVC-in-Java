The rumours of a remastered MW2 campaign have been long standing and come from several sources. Initially, at least in recent history, it began on Reddit, where a datamine into Modern Warfare Season 3 found details of the then unreleased Call of Duty Warzone, as well as details on a MW2 remaster.

Subsequently, Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered was rated by a South Korean games rating board, and a Twitter account called Okami - which previously accurately dated Call of Duty Warzone ahead of launch - suggested Modern Warfare was releasing March 30.
